# Bookify
Bookify is an demo website which could be used for booking accommodations.

It is available publicly here: https://bookify-mikilll.netlify.app/

Features:
- Fully responsive -> you can test it on mobiles and tablets
- Written in Vue.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- No CSS frameworks used (like Bootstrap, Vuetify, etc.)
- Utilizes CSS FlexBox and Grid
- Uses BEM as a CSS naming convention

Because this is just a demo website:
 - There is only one view -> the links to different pages are not working
 - There is no communication with backend -> the data is static
